Build a full-stack interactive website called “Smart Urban Planner” powered by NASA Earth Observation data.
The platform should allow urban planners, city officials, and citizens to visualize environmental data, plan interventions, and get AI-driven recommendations.

Core Features:

Data Integration:

Fetch & visualize NASA Earth Observation datasets (Air Quality, Water Quality, Temperature, Land Use, Vegetation NDVI).

Support multiple layers via a map dashboard (heatmaps, overlays, legends).

User Inputs:

City/location input (name or coordinates).

Problem type selection (Air Quality, Water, Heat, Green Space, Flood/Drought, Housing, Industrial Impact).

Time range (past years → present).

Data layer toggles (AQI, NDVI, land use, pollution, etc.).

Optional: Upload local datasets (CSV, GeoJSON).

Core Dashboard:

Map-based view (Leaflet/Mapbox).

Graphs (Chart.js / Plotly) for temporal changes.

Summary cards (AQI, vegetation health, heat intensity, water index).

Insights panel with simple recommendations (e.g., “Add green cover in Zone X”).

AI Planner Module:

Predictive analytics using past data (forecast pollution, heat, flood risk).

“What-if simulator” → test interventions (increase green cover, add housing, etc.).

Auto-generate policy suggestions.

Community Hub:

Citizens report issues (mark location + text/photo).

Crowdsourced feedback layer displayed on map.

Gamified leaderboard for engagement.

Policy Insights Page:

Sustainability & Wellbeing Index (composite score per zone).

Downloadable PDF reports with charts, maps, recommendations.

Comparative scenario analysis (“Business as Usual” vs “Sustainable Growth”).

Navigation Flow:

Home Page (Intro, NASA data explanation, call-to-action).

Dashboard Page (main visualizer).

AI Planner Page (simulations).

Community Hub Page.

Policy Insights Page.

About/Team Page.

UI/UX Requirements:

Use React.js (or Next.js) + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for a clean, modern design.

Responsive & mobile-friendly.

Map interactions must be smooth (zoom, draw boundary, toggle layers).

Futuristic theme with animated transitions.

Backend:

Python (Flask or FastAPI).

PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geo-data.

Integrate with NASA APIs (EarthData, GIBS, MODIS NDVI, Open AQ).

Bonus Features (if possible):

Chatbot assistant: “Ask SmartPlanner” (AI chatbot for city insights).

Digital Twin (3D model of city with growth simulation).

Story mode: “Future City” simulator showing growth under different policies.

Deliverables:

A fully working prototype hosted on free deployment platforms (Render, Vercel, or Netlify).

Downloadable policy reports (PDF).

Demo-ready UI with futuristic animations.
